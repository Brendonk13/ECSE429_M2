  Scenario Outline: (Normal flow) Update a valid task with a new description
    Given I have an existing valid task with title <title> and description <oldDescription>
      And the new description <newDescription> is not the same as the old description <oldDescription>
     When I update the description to <newDescription>
     Then the task with title <title> should have description <newDescription>
      And the task with title <title> should not have description <oldDescription>
      
    Examples: 
      | title      | oldDescription    | newDescription            |
      | task1      | valid description | more detailed description |
      | homework   | do homework       | do textbook practice      |
      | assignment | do assignment     | create gherkin scripts    |

  Scenario Outline: (Alternate flow) Add a description to a valid task with no description
    Given I have an existing valid task with title <title> and no description
     When I update the description to <description>
     Then the task with title <title> should have description <description>
      
    Examples: 
      | title      | description   |

     Then the task with title <title> should have description <newDescription>
