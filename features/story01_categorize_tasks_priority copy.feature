# Feature: Categorize tasks by priority

# (User story) As a student, I categorize tasks as HIGH, MEDIUM or LOW priority, so I can better manage my time.

#   Scenario Outline: (Normal flow) Create a new valid task with a given priority
#     Given I have three precreated priority levels in my system
#      When I create a new task with title <title> and priority level <priority>
#      Then the task should have category <priority>
  
#     Examples: 
#       | title      | priority |
#       | new_task_1 | HIGH     | 
#       | new_task_2 | MEDIUM   | 
#       | new_task_3 | LOW      | 

#   Scenario Outline: (Alternate flow) Categorize an existing valid task by a given priority
#     Given I have three precreated priority levels in my system
#       And I have an existing valid task with title <title>
#      When I add the task to the category <priority>
#      Then the task should have category <priority>
      
#     Examples: 
#       | title | priority |
#       | task1 | HIGH     | 
#       | task2 | MEDIUM   | 
#       | task3 | LOW      | 

#   Scenario Outline: (Error flow) Categorize a non-existent/invalid task by a given priority
#     Given I have three precreated priority levels in my system
#       And I do not have an existing valid task with id <invalidID>
#      When I add the task to the category <priority>
#      Then there should be an error returned from the system
#       And there should be no task with id <invalidID>
      
#     Examples: 
#       | invalidID | priority |
#       | 111       | HIGH     | 
#       | 222       | MEDIUM   | 
#       | 333       | LOW      | 

#   Scenario Outline: (Error flow) Categorize a valid task by an invalid priority
#     Given I have three precreated priority levels in my system
#       And <priority> is not the name of an existing category
#       And I have an existing valid task with title <title>
#      When I add the task to the category <priority>
#      Then the task should not have category <priority>
      
#     Examples: 
#       | title | priority        |
#       | task1 | med             | 
#       | task2 | test            | 
#       | task3 | " "             |
