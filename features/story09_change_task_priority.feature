# Feature: Change task priority

# (User story) As a student, I want to adjust the priority of a task, to help better manage my time.
# ​(Author) Brendon


#   Scenario Outline: (Normal flow) Update a valid task with a new priority
#     Given I have three precreated priority levels in my system
#       And I have an existing valid task with title <title> and priority <oldPriority>
#       And the new priority <newPriority> is not the same as the old priority <oldPriority>
#      When I add the task to the category <newPriority>
#      Then the task should have category <newPriority>
#       And the task should not have category <oldPriority>
      
#     Examples: 
#       | title | oldPriority | newPriority |
#       | task1 | HIGH        | MEDIUM      |
#       | task2 | MEDIUM      | HIGH        |
#       | task3 | LOW         | LOW         |

#   Scenario Outline: (Alternate flow) Update a valid task with the same priority
#     Given I have three precreated priority levels in my system
#       And I have an existing valid task with title <title> and priority <oldPriority>
#       And the new priority <newPriority> is the same as the old priority <oldPriority>
#      When I add the task to the category <newPriority>
#      Then the task should have category <newPriority>
      
#     Examples: 
#       | title | oldPriority | newPriority |
#       | task1 | HIGH        | HIGH        |
#       | task2 | MEDIUM      | MEDIUM      |
#       | task3 | LOW         | LOW         |
